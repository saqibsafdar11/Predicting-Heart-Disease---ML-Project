# Predicting Heart Disease
 ML Project using KNN approach

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) every year.

There are multiple risk factors that could contribute to CVD in an individual, such as unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, or mental illness. Identifying these risk factors early on could help prevent many premature deaths.

An R&D company that focuses on providing healthcare solutions. The company has collected anonymized data from multiple hospitals on several patients. The dataset includes relevant information for each patient, such as their personal information and some medical data, including whether or not they have had heart disease before. Our aim is to use the dataset to accurately predict the likelihood of a new patient having heart disease in the future.

This Jupyter Notebook is focused on building a classifier to predict heart disease based on various features. The notebook starts with data exploration and preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature selection. It then proceeds to build a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier using different features and hyperparameter optimization. The model is evaluated on a test set and achieves an accuracy of around 87%.

The notebook also discusses the impact of gender imbalance on the model's performance and suggests potential next steps for further improvement, such as exploring different features, trying other algorithms, and evaluating the model on different datasets with better gender balance.

Overall, the notebook provides a step-by-step guide on building a heart disease classifier using k-NN and highlights important considerations in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.
